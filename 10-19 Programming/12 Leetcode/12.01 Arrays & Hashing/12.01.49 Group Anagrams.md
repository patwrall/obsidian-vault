# Group Anagrams

## Problem Statement
Given an array of strings `strs`, group the <span data-keyword="anagram">anagrams</span> together. You can return the answer in any order.

 

>[!Example]+ Example 1
>**Input**: `strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]`
>**Output**: `[["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]`
>**Explanation**:
>- There is no string in strs that can be rearranged to form `"bat"`. 	 - The strings `"nat"` and `"tan"` are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other. 	 - The strings `"ate"`, `"eat"`, and `"tea"` are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.   

>[!Example]+ Example 2
>**Input**: `strs = [""]`
>**Output**: `[[""]]`

>[!Example]+ Example 3
>**Input**: `strs = ["a"]`
>**Output**: `[["a"]]`

>[!warning]+ Constraints
>- `1 <= strs.length <= 10^4`
>
>- `0 <= strs[i].length <= 100`
>
>- `strs[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
