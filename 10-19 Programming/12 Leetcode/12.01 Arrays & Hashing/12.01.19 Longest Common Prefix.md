## Problem Statement
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string `""`.

 

>[!Example]+ Example 1
>**Input**: `strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]`
>**Output**: `"fl"
`

>[!Example]+ Example 2
>**Input**: `strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]`
>**Output**: `""`
>**Explanation**:
>There is no common prefix among the input strings. 

>[!warning]+ Constraints
>- `1 <= strs.length <= 200`
>
>- `0 <= strs[i].length <= 200`
>
>- `strs[i]` consists of only lowercase English letters if it is non-empty.
